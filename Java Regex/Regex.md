## Java Regular Expression (Java Regex) ##

### Regular Expressions ###
A *Regular Expression* defines a search pattern for strings. *regex* is nothing but the abbrevation for regular expression.
The search pattern can be anything from a simple character, a fixed string or a complex expression containing special characters describing the pattern.
Regular Expressions can be used to search, edit and manipulate text.

Java provides the ```java.util.regex``` package for pattern matching with regular expressions.
